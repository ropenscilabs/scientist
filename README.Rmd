[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

__Experiment with changes in an R project__


Inspired by the Ruby gem [scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist) -
but instead of targeted at web apps, this project targets researchers/etc. 
that want to compare changes in their code in a rigorous fashion.

## Install

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/scientist")
```

```{r}
library(scientist)
```

## Usage

Initialize an experiment

```{r}
res <- Experiment$new(name = "jane")
```

Set your control code block

```{r}
res$control({
  x = 5
  x^2
})
```

Set your candidate code block. You can have 1 or more candidates, which are 
compared against the control.

```{r}
res$candidate({
  y = 5
  y^3
})
```

Now you can see some control and candidate details

```{r}
res
```

Run the experiment

```{r}
res$run()
```

Get the results

```{r}
res$control_result
res$candidate_results
```

Get all results plus timing data

```{r}
res$result()
```

Publish results - opens a page in your default browser

```{r eval=FALSE}
res$publish()
```
